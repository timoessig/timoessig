Hi, I am Timo, a mathematician from Germany. 
I am interested in
  - math research in singularity theory, especially intersection homology, characteristic classes, etc
  - helping to bring university teaching into the 21st century

I am working on 
  - some math research projects
  - an online course for university math topics that includes interactive and smart question boxes

Feel free to reach out to me via mail to essig(at)math(dot)uni-kiel(dot)de
